  \captionof{figure}{\textbf{Overview of MulT.} (Left) In our MulT framework, we jointly train multiple vision tasks, using a single encoder and a consistent decoder architecture with a task specific decoder head. The shared attention in our framework, further facilitates the joint learning between the multiple tasks. (Right)~ Our MulT model produces better results than both the single dedicated task models (Single task transformer) and the Multitask CNN baseline~\cite{standley2019}. Best seen on screen and zoomed in.}%
